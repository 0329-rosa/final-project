file beamforming presents the graph in frequency domain showing that with the antenna number changes 
the result changes as well, more antennas allow the beam to be more focusing.
file Pareto presents the optimal beamforming vector under pareto boundary. any rate under pareto boundary can be seen as an optimization problem.
the main file presents the work of sensing and communciation rates changes with distance and transmitting power
